### Description

This utility enables you to import data from any Access, MS SQL Sevrer or ODBC complaint data source and generate unlimited Word documents using templates. YOu can create templates of your own &amp; filter the you want. You can save the whole action as profiles for doing the same action over &amp; over by a few mouse clicks. Sample database &amp; usage is included. You need to have

MS Word installed on the system. You also may need to have MDAC 2.8 that can be found at

(note that the ActiveX is not the objective here!). I am grateful to Gongchuki for his Chameleon button. This will also show the beginners how to use ADO for any kind of

database in a modular way, creat &amp; use UserControls, clean &amp; structured programming. You may visit
